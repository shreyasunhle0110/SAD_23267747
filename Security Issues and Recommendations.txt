Security Issues and Recommendations
====================================

1. Hardcoded Database Credentials
---------------------------------
- Issue: Database username and password are hardcoded in the code.
- Risk: If the source code is leaked, attackers can gain access to the database.
- Fix: Use environment variables or a secure configuration file to store sensitive credentials.

2. SQL Injection Vulnerabilities
--------------------------------
- Issue: SQL queries are constructed using string concatenation.
- Fix: Prepared statements are now used to prevent SQL injection.

3. Weak Password Storage
------------------------
- Issue: Passwords are stored in plain text in the database.
- Fix: Passwords are now hashed using bcrypt before storing them.

4. Missing Input Validation
---------------------------
- Issue: User inputs are not validated before processing.
- Risk: This can lead to injection attacks or unexpected behavior.
- Fix: Validate and sanitize all user inputs to ensure they meet expected formats.

5. Hardcoded Cryptographic Secrets
-----------------------------------
- Issue: Cryptographic secrets may be hardcoded in the code.
- Risk: Hardcoded secrets can be extracted from the code.
- Fix: Use environment variables or secure key management systems for cryptographic keys.

6. Lack of HTTPS Enforcement
----------------------------
- Issue: The application does not enforce HTTPS for secure communication.
- Risk: Data transmitted over HTTP can be intercepted by attackers.
- Fix: Configure the application to use HTTPS and ensure all sensitive data is transmitted securely.

7. Missing Error Handling
-------------------------
- Issue: Errors are printed to the console instead of being logged securely.
- Risk: Sensitive information may be exposed in logs or error messages.
- Fix: Use a secure logging framework (e.g., SLF4J) and avoid exposing sensitive details.

8. Missing Access Control
-------------------------
- Issue: There is no evidence of role-based access control (RBAC) or user authorization checks.
- Risk: Unauthorized users may access restricted functionality.
- Fix: Implement RBAC to restrict access based on user roles.

9. Insecure Database Connection
-------------------------------
- Issue: The database connection string disables SSL.
- Risk: Data transmitted between the application and the database is not encrypted.
- Fix: Enable SSL for database connections.

10. Excessive Permissions for Database User
-------------------------------------------
- Issue: The database user likely has full permissions (e.g., GRANT ALL).
- Risk: If the application is compromised, attackers can perform destructive operations on the database.
- Fix: Restrict the database user's permissions to only what is necessary.

11. Missing CSRF Protection
---------------------------
- Issue: If the application has web-based components, there is no evidence of CSRF protection.
- Risk: Attackers can trick authenticated users into performing unintended actions.
- Fix: Use CSRF tokens for all sensitive operations.

12. Missing Logging and Monitoring
----------------------------------
- Issue: There is no evidence of logging or monitoring for security events.
- Risk: Security incidents may go undetected.
- Fix: Implement logging for critical actions and monitor logs for suspicious activity.

13. Use of Deprecated Libraries
-------------------------------
- Issue: The project uses an outdated MySQL connector (mysql-connector-java-5.1.48.jar).
- Risk: Older libraries may have unpatched vulnerabilities.
- Fix: Upgrade to the latest version of the MySQL connector.

14. Lack of Secure Session Management
-------------------------------------
- Issue: There is no evidence of secure session management (e.g., session timeouts, secure cookies).
- Risk: Attackers may hijack user sessions.
- Fix: Implement secure session management practices.

15. Unrestricted File Uploads
-----------------------------
- Issue: If file uploads are allowed, they may not be restricted.
- Risk: Attackers may upload malicious files.
- Fix: Validate file types and scan uploaded files for malware.
